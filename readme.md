# Ermak Sofle Pico Keymap

This keymap is made by [Ross Hadden](https://github.com/rosshadden) for the [sofle_pico](https://github.com/JellyTitan/sofle_pico). 

It is based on the [engram layout](https://engram.dev/), modified enough that I felt like naming it something.
The name is a combination of `colemak` and `Ermac` (a character I remember from from Mortal Kombat III).

## flashing

```bash
# left
qmk flash --keyboard sofle_pico --keymap ermak --bootloader uf2-split-left

# right
qmk flash --keyboard sofle_pico --keymap ermak --bootloader uf2-split-right
```
